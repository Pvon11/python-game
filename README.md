## Introduction

"Embarking on Python's fundamental journey! Learning core concepts, unleashing possibilities, empowering brilliance."

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to develop this game:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for building the game logic and backend functionality.

- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for Python used to create the web application and handle HTTP requests.

- **HTML**: Used for creating the game interface and rendering the web pages.

- **JavaScript**: Used for handling client-side interactions (not extensively used in this version of the game).

- **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework used for styling and creating a responsive layout for a visually appealing user experience.

## Setup

To run the Rock Paper Scissors game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/username/rock-paper-scissors.git`.

2. Make sure you have Python (version 3.6 or higher) installed on your machine.

3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd rock-paper-scissors`.

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

5. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

6. Run the Flask app: `python app.py`.

7. Open your web browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to play the game.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

2. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) in the input field and click the "Play" button.

3. The computer will randomly choose its move (rock, paper, or scissors).

4. The game result will be displayed on the screen, indicating whether you won, lost, or it's a tie.

5. You can play again by clicking the "Play Again" button.

## Game Logic
The game logic is implemented in the Python backend, and the Flask app handles the user inputs and rendering of the game result.
